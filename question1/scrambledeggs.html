      <p>This is one of my favorite foods. Here is a recipe for deliciously
      scramled eggs.</p>
<h2>Ingredeients</h2>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1 tbs butter</li>
<li>1 tbs creme</li>
<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
  <li>melt butter in frying pan over medium heat</li>
  <li>Gently mix the eggs and creme in a bowl</li>
  <li>Once the butter has melted add creme and eggs</li>
  <li>Using a spatula fold the eggs from the edge of the pan to the center every
  20 seconds (as if you are making an omelette)</li>
  <li>When the eggs are still moist remove from the heat (it will continue to cook on
    the plate until served)</li>
  <ol>
